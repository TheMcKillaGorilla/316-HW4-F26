/**
 * app.ts
 *
 * Builds the Express application without starting it. server.ts starts it for
 * real, and the tests hand it straight to supertest, which is why building and
 * listening are kept apart.
 *
 * CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY
 * -----------------------
 * Every request travels down the app.use() calls below, in order. Each link
 * either answers the request or calls next() to hand it on:
 *
 *   requestLogger    notes the request, always passes it on
 *   express.json()   turns a JSON body into req.body, or passes on an error
 *   cookieParser()   turns the Cookie header into req.cookies
 *   /api/auth        register, log in and log out, open to anybody
 *   /api/users       the logged in user's own account
 *   /api/lists       the logged in user's own lists
 *   notFound         reached only if nothing above answered
 *   errorHandler     reached whenever anything above passed on an error
